This repository contains experimental Model Context Protocol (or MCP) servers for interacting with Algolia APIs. We're sharing it for you to explore and experiment with. 
Feel free to use it, fork it, or build on top of it ‚Äî but just know that it's not officially supported by Algolia and isn't covered under our SLA. 

We might update it, break it, or remove it entirely at any time. If you customize or configure things here, there's a chance that work could be lost. Also, using MCP in production could affect your Algolia usage.

If you have feedback or ideas (even code!), we'd love to hear it. Just know that we might use it to help improve our products. This project is provided "as is" and "as available," with no guarantees or warranties. To be super clear: MCP isn't considered an "API Client" for SLA purposes.


## ‚ú® Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest release from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/algolia/mcp-node/releases)
2. **Authenticate** with your Algolia account
3. **Connect** to Claude Desktop
4. Start asking questions about your Algolia data!

> [!NOTE]
> For step-by-step instructions, follow the [installation guide](#-installation) and [configuration for Claude Desktop](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration).

## üöÄ Features

Algolia Node.js MCP enables natural language interactions with your Algolia data through Claude Desktop. This implementation allows you to:

- **Search and manipulate** indices with natural language
- **Analyze** search metrics and performance
- **Monitor** application status and incidents
- **Visualize** your data with AI-generated charts and graphs
- **Integrate** seamlessly with Claude Desktop through the Model Context Protocol

## üîÆ Usage Examples

Here are some example prompts to get you started:

### Account Management
```
"What is the email address associated with my Algolia account?"
```

### Applications
```
"List all my Algolia apps."
"List all the indices are in my 'e-commerce' application and format them into a table sorted by entries."
"Show me the configuration for my 'products' index."
```

### Search & Indexing
```
"Search my 'products' index for Nike shoes under $100."
"Add the top 10 programming books to my 'library' index using their ISBNs as objectIDs."
"How many records do I have in my 'customers' index?"
```

### Analytics & Insights
```
"What's the no-results rate for my 'products' index in the DE region? Generate a graph using React and Recharts."
"Show me the top 10 searches with no results in the DE region from last week."
```

### Monitoring & Performance
```
"Are there any ongoing incidents at Algolia?"
"What's the current latency for my 'e-commerce' index?"
"Show me a visualization of my daily account usage for the past month."
```

> [!TIP]
> Try providing your specific application and index in your initial prompt to avoid unnecessary back and forth.

## üì¶ Installation

### macOS

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/algolia/mcp-node/releases)
2. Extract the `.zip` file
3. From your terminal, remove quarantine flag to allow execution:
   ```sh
   xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine <path_to_executable>
   ```
   > **Note:** This step is necessary as the executable is not signed with an Apple Developer account. If you prefer, you can build from source instead.
4. Run the authentication command:
   ```sh
   <path_to_executable> authenticate
   ```
   This will open your browser to authenticate with the Algolia Dashboard.

### Linux

Claude Desktop on Linux now supports seamless integration with Algolia and other MCP servers, making advanced AI workflows possible natively on your system.

#### 1. Setup Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop can be built and installed on Arch Linux and derivatives using the provided PKGBUILD. This process creates a fully integrated native application, including menu entries, tray icon with Ctrl+Alt+Space shortcut, and full support for Model Context Protocol (MCP).

##### **Installation (Arch Linux)**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaddrick/claude-desktop-arch.git
   cd claude-desktop-arch
   ```

2. **Update checksums (recommended):**
   ```bash
   updpkgsums
   ```

3. **Build and install the package:**
   ```bash
   makepkg -si
   ```

   - This will automatically detect your architecture, fetch the latest official installer, extract and patch the app, install dependencies, and integrate Claude Desktop into your system.

4. **Launch Claude Desktop:**
   - Use your applications menu, or run:
     ```bash
     claude-desktop
     ```

##### **Features**

- Native tray menu (works on KDE, GNOME, etc.)
- Ctrl+Alt+Space popup for quick access
- Full MCP tool support via configuration file
- Seamless system integration

##### **Configuration File Location**

To enable MCP tools, edit:

```
~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

---

#### Algolia MCP on Linux

The Algolia MCP Node server allows Claude Desktop to access and search Algolia indices directly as a tool.

##### **Node.js Setup (Recommended: nvm)**

1. **Install Node Version Manager (nvm):**
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc, depending on your shell
   ```

2. **Install and use the latest LTS Node.js:**
   ```bash
   nvm install --lts
   nvm use --lts
   ```

##### **Install Algolia MCP Node**

1. **Clone and set up the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/algolia/mcp-node.git
   cd mcp-node
   npm install
   ```

2. *(Optional: Test running the server manually)*
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

##### **Configure Claude Desktop to Use Algolia MCP**

1. **Edit `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`**  
   Add (or merge) the following section, replacing paths and credentials as needed:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "algolia-mcp": {
         "command": "/home/youruser/.nvm/versions/node/vXX.X.X/bin/node",
         "args": ["/full/path/to/mcp-node/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "ALGOLIA_APP_ID": "",
           "ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME": "",
           "ALGOLIA_API_KEY": "",
           "ALGOLIA_WRITE_API_KEY": ""
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   - Use absolute paths for both `node` and `index.js` if using nvm.
   - Fill in your actual Algolia credentials.

2. **Restart Claude Desktop** to apply the new configuration.

##### **Validation**

- Open Claude Desktop.
- Click "Search and tools" in the sidebar or toolbar.
- You should see **"algolia-mcp"** listed among available tools:
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba833cb2-3fbb-470d-9616-049ae33b58a0" alt="Tools show 'algolia-mcp'" width="600">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95f86190-d329-4661-bc02-050321d2a86d" alt="List of algolia tools" width="250">
- If visible, your MCP integration is working! üéâ

---

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure the config file is valid JSON and at the correct path (`~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`).
- Use absolute paths in the `"command"` and `"args"` fields, especially if using nvm.
- Restart Claude Desktop after every config change.
- If the tool does not appear, run Claude Desktop from a terminal to check for errors.
