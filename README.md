## ‚ú® Quick Start

1. **Download** the latest release from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/algolia/mcp-node/releases)
2. **Authenticate** with your Algolia account
3. **Connect** to Claude Desktop
4. Start asking questions about your Algolia data!

> [!NOTE]
> For step-by-step instructions, follow the [installation guide](#-installation) and [configuration for Claude Desktop](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration).

## üöÄ Features

Algolia Node.js MCP enables natural language interactions with your Algolia data through Claude Desktop. This implementation allows you to:

- **Search and manipulate** indices with natural language
- **Analyze** search metrics and performance
- **Monitor** application status and incidents
- **Visualize** your data with AI-generated charts and graphs
- **Integrate** seamlessly with Claude Desktop through the Model Context Protocol

## üîÆ Usage Examples

Here are some example prompts to get you started:

### Account Management
```
"What is the email address associated with my Algolia account?"
"How many API keys do I have in my account?"
```

### Applications
```
"List all my Algolia apps and their creation dates."
"What indices are in my 'E-commerce' application?"
"Show me the configuration for my 'products' index."
```

### Search & Indexing
```
"Search my 'products' index for Nike shoes under $100."
"Add these 10 books to my 'library' index using their ISBNs as objectIDs."
"How many records do I have in my 'customers' index?"
```

### Analytics & Insights
```
"Generate a chart showing my search volume for the past month."
"What's the no-results rate for my 'products' index in the EU region? Generate a graph using React and Recharts."
"Show me the top 10 searches with no results from last week."
```

### Monitoring & Performance
```
"Are there any ongoing incidents at Algolia?"
"What's the current latency for my US application?"
"Show me a visualization of my API usage over the past week."
```

> [!TIP]
> Try providing your specific application and index in your initial prompt to avoid unnecessary back and forth.

## üì¶ Installation

### macOS

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/algolia/mcp-node/releases)
2. Extract the `.zip` file
3. From your terminal, remove quarantine flag to allow execution:
   ```sh
   xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine <path_to_executable>
   ```
   > **Note:** This step is necessary as the executable is not signed with an Apple Developer account. If you prefer, you can build from source instead.
4. Run the authentication command:
   ```sh
   <path_to_executable> authenticate
   ```
   This will open your browser to authenticate with the Algolia Dashboard.

### Windows & Linux

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/algolia/mcp-node
   cd mcp-node
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure Claude Desktop for development:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "algolia-mcp": {
         "command": "<PATH_TO_BIN>/node",
         "args": [
           "--experimental-strip-types",
           "--no-warnings=ExperimentalWarning",
           "<PATH_TO_PROJECT>/src/app.ts"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

> **Note:** You'll need to restart Claude Desktop after making code changes.

### Build

```sh
npm run build -- --outfile dist/algolia-mcp
```

### Testing and Debugging

Use the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector) for testing and debugging:

1. Run the debug script:
   ```sh
   cd mcp-node
   npm run debug
   ```

2. Open http://127.0.0.1:6274/ in your browser
3. Click **Connect** to start the server
4. Send test requests through the inspector interface

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"App not responding" error:** Ensure you've removed the quarantine attribute on macOS
- **Authentication failures:** Try logging out and authenticating again
- **Claude can't access tools:** Verify your MCP configuration in Claude Desktop settings
